### **1. Hangman Game**

This is a console-based Hangman game where the player tries to guess a hidden word. The game reads a list of words from a file, selects one at random, and a player can guess letters. The game tracks wrong guesses and provides visual feedback. The player wins by guessing the word or loses after a certain number of incorrect guesses.

**Topics Covered:**
* File I/O for reading from a text file
* Error handling with `try-catch` blocks
* Using `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage
* Random number generation
* Loops and conditional statements
* String manipulation

### **2. Weight Converter**

This is a simple command-line program that converts weight between pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kgs). The user can choose a conversion direction and enter a weight value to get the converted result.

**Topics Covered:**
* Basic I/O operations (`Scanner`)
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)

### **3. Car Park Management System**

This project simulates a simple car park management system. It models different vehicle types (Motorcycle, Car, Truck) and their corresponding sizes. The system can park and release vehicles, manage parking capacity, and calculate parking fees based on vehicle size and duration. This project is a solid demonstration of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

**Topics Covered:**
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
* `enum` for defining constants
* `ArrayList` for data storage
*  Method overriding

### **4. Company Employee Management**

This project simulates a basic company and employee management system. It models employees with attributes like ID, name, position, and salary. The system allows adding new employees to a company, displaying a list of current employees, and calculating the total salary of all employees within the company. This project is an ideal demonstration of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

**Topics Covered:**
* Arrays
* Data encapsulation
* Constructors

### **5. Product Management System**

This project simulates a simple product management system. It models a hierarchy of products, with a generic `Product` class and specific subclasses for `ElectronicProduct` and `BookProduct`. The system demonstrates how to handle different types of products and calculate taxes using inheritance and polymorphism.

**Topics Covered:**
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
* Abstract classes and methods
* Method overriding
* Data encapsulation

### **6. Shape Calculation**

This project demonstrates a system for calculating the area, perimeter, and volume of various geometric shapes. It utilizes abstract classes and interfaces to create a clear hierarchy for 2D shapes (Circle, Square) and 3D shapes (Cube, Cone). The project is an excellent example of applying key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

**Topics Covered:**
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism)
* Abstract classes and methods
* Interfaces
* Data encapsulation
* `ArrayList` for data storage

### **7. Weather Data Displayer**

This project simulates a weather station that provides real-time weather data to various display units. It uses the Observer design pattern to allow display units to automatically update whenever new measurements (temperature and humidity) are received from the weather station. It includes a display for current weather data and another for temperature statistics (min, max, and average).

**Topics Covered:**
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
* Observer design pattern
* Interfaces and their implementation
* `ArrayList` for managing observers
